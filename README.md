## Project Name: The Kidnapping of J Doe 

## Project Description: 
### What is it?
It is the 5 stages of grief told through the experience of a kidnapping victim.
### Overall Concept and Theme
We wanted to structure the experience as if a kidnapping victim had donated their diary to a crime museum, and the museum had used different narrators to record each (to obscure the identity of the victim).
### Desired Experience
While listening to each diary entry, we wanted the listener to be able to feel the seasons changing through the background audio, and also feel empathy for the victim throughout the narrative. The looping animations were representative of the victim's sense of being hopelessly stuck in that place.
## Process: 
### Brainstorming 
### Implementation







## Reflection/Evaluation: (This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.)
