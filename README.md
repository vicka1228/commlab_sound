## Project Name: The Kidnapping of J Doe 

## Project Description: 
### What is it?
It is an audio experience of the 5 stages of grief as told through the diary of a kidnapping victim.
### Overall Concept and Theme
We wanted to structure the experience as if a kidnapping victim had donated their diary to a crime museum, and the museum had used different narrators to record five excerpts from the diary (to obscure the identity of the victim).
### Desired Experience
While listening to each diary entry, we wanted the listener to be able to feel the seasons changing through the background audio, and also feel empathy for the victim throughout the narrative. The looping animations were representative of the victim's sense of being hopelessly stuck in that place for perpetuity.
## Process: 
### Brainstorming
For the initial process of brainstorming, we collected story ideas that would sound good over audio, and were not too difficult or complicated to record. We also wanted to have a mystery/crime/noir aesthetic to it, as these forms of media work very well over audio if suspense can be built and maintained. Finally, we were left with two ideas: the last moments of an armed robbery victim in the form of WhatsApp voice messages, and our present idea, that of a diary of a kidnapping victim. We liked the more hopeful nature and broader scope of the second scenario, so we decided to go with that one.

Next, we decided to include the motif of the 5 stages of grief, as it gave each of us an opportunity to record an entry. We also decided to link each stage of grief with a seasonal theme: Spring for Denial, Summer for Anger, Fall for Bargaining, and Winter for Depression.
### Implementation
First, we made a script, which went through several rounds of editing to shorten it. Using the script, we recorded the diary entries, trying to get in vocal inflections to represent each stage. We found that recording on our mobile devices was better than recording on a stereo microphone for this case as it picked up less background noiseand gave clearer, unidirectional audio. We then collected a host of audio clips (licensed under Creative Commons) for background noises in each season. The recorded and background audios were corrected for noise and mixed in Audacity.
For our website, we decided to keep it relatively simple. We used HTML and CSS to create an object that looks like a cassette player. We then used CSS animations to make it seem as if the cassette player was actually reeling a tape while it played the introduction (and later Chapter 5). For the rest of our website, we used GIFs hosted in divs to represent each season. The GIFs are clickable, clicking on them plays the corresponding audio. Clicking again will pause the audio.
We coded on the website collaboratively using Replit, a web-based collaborative IDE.

## Reflection/Evaluation: (This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.)
We feel that our expectations have been met in this project. We have good audio, and good accompanying visuals. We had considered more complicated scroll animations for the entire wesite, and automatically pausing audio on scrolling away, but these were found to be either difficult to implement in the time frame, or would have interfered with the User Experience.
Overall, we are happy with this project, and we did learn a lot while making it.
